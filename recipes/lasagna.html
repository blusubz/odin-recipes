            <li><strong>Prepare the meat sauce:</strong> Brown ground meat with onion and garlic. Drain the fat, then stir in tomato products and seasonings. Simmer the sauce to let the flavors meld.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> If using regular lasagna sheets, cook them according to package directions until al dente. If using oven-ready sheets, skip this step.</li>

                <li>Spread about one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
